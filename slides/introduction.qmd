**Reproducibility** is about results that can be obtained by someone else (or you in the future) given the **same data** and the **same code**. This is a technical problem.

<br/>

## Why does it matter?


> An article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.

## Reproducibility spectrum

. . .

<br/>

Each degree of reproducibility requires additional skills and time. While some of those skills (e.g. literal programming, version control, setting up environments) pay off in the long run, they can require a high up-front investment.

## Concepts

According to Wilson _et al._ (2017)[^wilson], good practices for a better reproducibility can be organized into the following six topics:
